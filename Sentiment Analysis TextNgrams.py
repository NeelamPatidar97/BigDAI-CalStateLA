# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Analyze Product Ratings**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We want to find the product that customers like most, but must guard against being misled by products that have few ratings assigned. Run the following query to find the product with the highest average using DESC among all those with at least 50 ratings:

# COMMAND ----------

# Find the product with the highest average rating among those with at least 50 ratings
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, avg, count, desc

# Calculate average ratings and filter products with at least 50 ratings
avg_ratings_df = ratings_df.groupBy("prod_id") \
    .agg(avg("rating").alias("avg_rating"), count("*").alias("num")) \
    .filter(col("num") >= 50) \
    .orderBy(desc("avg_rating"))

# Show the top product
top_product = avg_ratings_df.limit(1)
display(top_product)


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Now, below is the query to find the product with the lowest average using ASC instead of DESC among products with at least 50 ratings (num >= 50). 

# COMMAND ----------

# Find the product with the lowest average rating among those with at least 50 ratings
lowest_avg_ratings_df = avg_ratings_df.orderBy(col("avg_rating"))
bottom_product = lowest_avg_ratings_df.limit(1)
display(bottom_product)


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We observed earlier that customers are very dissatisfied with one of the products that Dualcore sells. Although numeric ratings can help identify which product that is, they don’t tell Dualcore why customers don’t like the product. We could simply read through all the comments associated with that product to learn this information, but that approach doesn’t scale. Next, you will use Hive’s text processing support to analyze the comments.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The following query normalizes all comments on that product to lowercase, breaks them into individual words using the *SENTENCES* function, and passes those to the *NGRAMS* function to find the five most common bigrams (two-‐ word combinations).

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer, NGram
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, lower, explode, size, concat_ws
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Filter the ratings DataFrame for the specified product ID
product_ratings_df = ratings_df.filter(col("prod_id") == 1274673)

# Convert messages to lowercase
product_ratings_df = product_ratings_df.withColumn("message_lower", lower(col("message")))

# Tokenize the messages into words
tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol="message_lower", outputCol="words")
tokenized_df = tokenizer.transform(product_ratings_df)

# Generate bigrams (n=2) from the tokenized words
ngram = NGram(n=2, inputCol="words", outputCol="bigrams")
bigrams_df = ngram.transform(tokenized_df)

# Explode the bigrams to get each bigram in a separate row and count their frequencies
exploded_bigrams_df = bigrams_df.select(explode(col("bigrams")).alias("bigram"))

# Count the frequency of each bigram
bigram_counts_df = exploded_bigrams_df.groupBy("bigram").count() \
    .withColumnRenamed("count", "estfrequency") \
    .orderBy(F.desc("estfrequency"))

# Display the result in the required format, showing the top 5 bigrams
display(bigram_counts_df.limit(5))


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Most of these words are too common to provide much insight, though the word “expensive” does stand out in the list. Modify the previous query to find the five most common trigrams (three-‐ word combinations)

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer, NGram
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, lower, explode
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Filter the ratings DataFrame for the specified product ID
product_ratings_df = ratings_df.filter(col("prod_id") == 1274673)

# Convert messages to lowercase
product_ratings_df = product_ratings_df.withColumn("message_lower", lower(col("message")))

# Tokenize the messages into words
tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol="message_lower", outputCol="words")
tokenized_df = tokenizer.transform(product_ratings_df)

# Generate trigrams (n=3) from the tokenized words
ngram = NGram(n=3, inputCol="words", outputCol="trigrams")
trigrams_df = ngram.transform(tokenized_df)

# Explode the trigrams to get each trigram in a separate row
exploded_trigrams_df = trigrams_df.select(explode(col("trigrams")).alias("trigram"))

# Count the frequency of each trigram
trigram_counts_df = exploded_trigrams_df.groupBy("trigram").count() \
    .withColumnRenamed("count", "estfrequency") \
    .orderBy(F.desc("estfrequency"))

# Display the top 5 trigrams with their estimated frequency
display(trigram_counts_df.limit(5))


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Among the patterns you see in the result is the phrase “ten times more.” This might be related to the complaints that the product is too expensive. Now that you’ve identified a specific phrase, look at a few comments that contain it by running the below code:

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Filter the DataFrame for the specified product ID and messages containing the phrase "ten times more"
filtered_comments_df = ratings_df.filter(
    (col("prod_id") == 1274673) & 
    (col("message").like('%ten times more%'))
)

# Display the top 3 comments that match the condition
display(filtered_comments_df.select("message").limit(3))


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We can infer that customers are complaining about the price of this item, but the comment alone doesn’t provide enough detail. One of the words (“red”) in that comment was also found in the list of trigrams from the earlier query. Run below query that will find all distinct comments containing the word “red” that are associated with product ID 1274673

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Filter the DataFrame for the specified product ID and comments containing the word "red"
distinct_comments_df = ratings_df.filter(
    (col("prod_id") == 1274673) & 
    (col("message").like('%red%'))
).select("message").distinct()

# Display the distinct comments
display(distinct_comments_df)


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The previous step should have displayed two comments:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC • “What is so special about red?”
# MAGIC
# MAGIC • “Why does the red one cost ten times more than the others?”
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The second comment implies that this product is overpriced relative to similar products. Following query will display the record for product ID 1274673 

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Filter the products DataFrame to display the record for product ID 1274673
product_record_df = products_df.filter(col("prod_id") == 1274673)

# Display the product record
display(product_record_df)


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Your query should have shown that the product was a “16GB USB Flash Drive (Red)” from the “Orion” brand. Next, run this query to identify similar products:

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Filter the products DataFrame for the specific name and brand conditions
filtered_products_df = products_df.filter(
    (col("name").like('%16 GB USB Flash Drive%')) & 
    (col("brand") == 'Orion')
)

# Display the filtered results
display(filtered_products_df)


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The query results show that there are three almost identical products, but the product with the negative reviews (the red one) costs about ten times as much as the others, just as some of the comments said.
# MAGIC Based on the cost and price columns, it appears that doing text processing on the product ratings has helped Dualcore uncover a pricing error.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Please run the following code to find out any words about red as well:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Step 1: Extract 1-Grams (Words) and Display
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This step involves tokenizing the text into individual words and exploding them to create 1-grams.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, lower, explode

# Step 1: Convert the message column to lowercase and tokenize it into individual words
# Equivalent to LOWER() and SENTENCES() in Hive.
tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol="message", outputCol="words")
tokenized_df = tokenizer.transform(ratings_df.withColumn("message", lower(col("message"))))

# Display the tokenized words (1-grams)
display(tokenized_df.select("message", "words"))


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Step 2: Explode the 1-Grams to Display Individual Words
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This step will explode the tokenized words to display each word (1-gram) in a separate row, similar to Hive’s EXPLODE function.

# COMMAND ----------

# Explode the words to create individual rows for each 1-gram
onegram_df = tokenized_df.select(explode(col("words")).alias("onegram"))

# Display the exploded 1-gram results
display(onegram_df)


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Step 3: Extract 2-Grams (Bigrams) and Display
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To extract 2-grams, you will generate bigrams from the tokenized words and then explode them.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.ml.feature import NGram

# Generate 2-grams (bigrams) from the tokenized words
ngram_2 = NGram(n=2, inputCol="words", outputCol="bigrams")
bigrams_df = ngram_2.transform(tokenized_df)

# Explode the bigrams to display each bigram in a separate row
exploded_bigrams_df = bigrams_df.select(explode(col("bigrams")).alias("bigram"))

# Display the exploded bigram results
display(exploded_bigrams_df)


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Step 4: Extract 4-Grams Starting with “red one”
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To find 4-grams that specifically start with "red one," generate 4-grams and filter for context.

# COMMAND ----------

# Generate 4-grams (n=4) from the tokenized words
ngram_4 = NGram(n=4, inputCol="words", outputCol="fourgrams")
fourgrams_df = ngram_4.transform(tokenized_df)

# Explode the 4-grams to create individual rows for each 4-gram
exploded_fourgrams_df = fourgrams_df.select(explode(col("fourgrams")).alias("fourgram"))

# Filter for 4-grams that specifically start with "red one"
context_snippets_df = exploded_fourgrams_df.filter(col("fourgram").rlike(r'^red one'))

# Display the filtered 4-grams that match the context
display(context_snippets_df.limit(10))
